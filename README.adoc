*TODO* follow you must. There are places in code annotated as todos, which guides ou

== Load balancing

. Create a randomized load balancer
.. Implement `LoadBalancingStrategy` so that the returned list of handlers will be randomized.
Dispatcher takes first to process message, so changing the order of handlers does the job.

== Scatter and gather

. The http://musicbrainz.org service is not very reliable, regularly returning `503` responses - Service temporarily unavailable.
To mitigate it we need to add appropriate retry policy, so that failing messages will be repeated.
.. Look for `RetryTemplate` class and how it can be used with request handling advices (http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/htmlsingle/#advice-classes)

. Despite retrials the response can eventually fail. Configure appropriate `errorChannel` so that error will be redirected there
.. Class `RequestHandlerRetryAdvice` can be further configured with `recoveryCallback` (initially empty) and `retryTemplate` (initially three retries).
.. Prepare a bean with will try only once and after failure redirect message to a newly created `myErrorChannel`.
.. Error channel can be set during constructing `ErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` bean.

== Result cache

. This about you it can be tested that we are dealing with cached value (in a reliable way - other than measuring time)
.. Generate cache-related `MessageHeader`
.. Preserve it between channels and eventually map it within the outbound gateway
.. Check in test if caching was successful (if the flag / header is set)

== Pipes and filters

. Some (most popular) products might come with subcategories (AGD / TV)
.. Implement product searches for subcategories, for example AGD/TV, using separate queue for category
.. Extend `Product` with subcategory field and process it accordingly
.. When you search for AGD you go to all services, when you search AGD/TV, you go to specific service

== Shared Spaces

. How to trace flow of messages through integration components?
.. Check MessageHistory and WireTap patterns

== Service orchestation

. AirBnB API doesn't work, find out why and fix it, and add fallback to different provider
.. You can use Google Places API as a fallback (create a separate fallback channel in a similar way as in `Result Cache` example
.. Use following url https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=hotels+near+{location}&amp;key={api-key} passing over location and api key
.. Use a following Google API key to proceed: `AIzaSyCvyRnNH7aSfWaDCG1n7IMpBEVM355scnY`

== Protocol adapter

. Make use of parameterized callback URL, don't hardcode it pass it as a part of HTTP request
. Implement retry when it is not possible to send callback
